# Elasticsearch-with-PHP
Implementing elasticsearch using PHP code. Note: Only for demo purposes to learn.

Tutorial followed: https://youtu.be/3xb1dHLg-Lk (credits to this channel!)
Steps:

1.	Download elasticsearch from their website. Follow instructions given online to setup JRE environment and variable paths.

2.	Run elasticsearch instance through elasticsearch.bat in bin folder. Check whether it’s running on localhost:9200.

3.	Create the index for your project.

4.	Install composer on your machine.

5.	Do “composer install” at the project location to get the vendor folder. Use GIT CMD if you are on windows.

6.	Use the sense plugin on chrome to add, manipulate data in your index and get acquainted to it. Bulk data can be added from here.

7.	File structure is as follows:  
-htdocs
  
  -esphpsearch
    
    -app
      
      -init.php
    
    -css
      
      -add.php
      -index.php
      -main.css
    
    -vendor
    
    -composer.json
    
    -composer.lock

Note: Composer.lock file and vendor directory are auto created when you run composer install on cmd. Do not download them and paste them.

8.	Code can be made efficient and scaled as per needs.

9.	Shoot up xampp and access your link to add data as well as to search data.
